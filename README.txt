js.bootstrapdatepicker
**********************

This library packages `Bootstrap Datepicker`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware
of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Bootstrap Datepicker`: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.bootstrapdatepicker``) are published to some URL.
